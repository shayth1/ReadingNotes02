## The Learning Pyramid
*what i learned for today:*
 

>Studies show that varying your study methods and materials will improve your retention and recall of information, and enhance your learning experience. The "learning pyramid", sometimes referred to as the "cone of learning", developed by the National Training Laboratory, suggests that most students only remember about 10% of what they read from textbooks, but retain nearly 90% of what they learn through teaching others. The Learning Pyramid model suggests that some methods of study are more effective than others and that varying study methods will lead to deeper learning and longer-term retention.

### Lecture

>The Learning Pyramid suggests that "Lecture" is one of the most ineffective methods for learning and retaining information. 

### Reading
>While more effective than Lecture, Reading is still one of the less effective methods for acquiring and retaining information, according to the Learning Pyramid. However, if you are a visual learner, reading textbooks will likely be a more effective learning method for you than for students with non-visual learning styles.
