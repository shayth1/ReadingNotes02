## HTML
* ### HTML Lists 
**HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists, for example :**
* * `<ol>` : The ordered list is created with the ol element.
* * `<ul>` : The unordered list is createdwith the ul element.
* * `<li>` : Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. (The li stands for list item).
* * `<dl>` : The definition list is created with the dl element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions
* * `<dt>` : This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
* * `<dd>` : This is used to contain the definition.

## CSS
* ### Boxes
You can set several properties that affect the appearance of
these boxes. In this chapter you will see how to:
* * Control the dimensions of your boxes
* * Create borders around boxes
* * Set margins and padding for boxes
* * Show and hide boxes

## JavaScript
* ### Basic JavaScript Instructions
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).

* ### Decisions and Loops
* * switch statements :
Use the `switch` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.A switch statement starts with a ariable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
