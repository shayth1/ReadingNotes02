**This is what I learned in class 201_06:**

* I learned the following:

    1. The browser vreate a model of the page and that called DOM tree.
    2. There are many methods to select element node in DOM, such as: getElementById(), querySelector(), etc...
    3. To repeat actions for the same node we use for loop.
