#### Introduction
>HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript are the languages that run the web. They’re very closely related, but they’re also designed for very specific tasks. Understanding how they interact will go a long way towards becoming a web developer.

#### Structure
>Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
The first line defines what type of contents the document contains. "`<!doctype html>`" means the page is written in HTML5. Properly formatted HTML pages should include , , and tags, which are all included in the example above. The page title, metadata, and links to referenced files are placed between the tags. The actual contents of the page go between the tags.

#### Extra Markup
>Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML
HTML 4 With the exception of a few elements added in HTML5 (which have been highlighted), the elements you have seen in this book were all available in HTML 4.
XHTML 1.0 In 1998, a language called XML was published. Its purpose was to allow people to write new markup languages. Since HTML was the most widely used markup language around, it was decided that HTML 4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of XML and it was renamed XHTML.
HTML5 Layout
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
