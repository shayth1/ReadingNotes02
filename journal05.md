## Pedagogy Vs Andragogy:
*journal 05*
>  what i learned for today:

* As an adult, you should strive to make your own self-learning experience successful.
* You should not rely entirely on what you learn from your professors, but rather you should continue to search for more resources. This is because you are a self-directed person.

* Before start learning, you must know why you learned something new; Once you have answered this question, you are ready to start.
*Naturally, adult learners seek information that is useful in their personal lives and work environment. This audience demands that their learning is relevant to their real-life issues, problems, and tasks and that their education will boost their performance levels and help them live their lives in a better and more satisfying way. Young audienceâ€™s learning, on the contrary, is subject-centered, meaning that the subject determines the sequence according to which the learning content units will be presented and taught.
